    <h1>Introducing Realism in International Relations Theory</h1>
    <p>In the discipline of International Relations (IR), realism is a school of thought that emphasises the competitive
        and conflictual side of international relations. Realism’s roots are often said to be found in some of
        humankind’s earliest historical writings, particularly Thucydides’ history of the Peloponnesian War, which raged
        between 431 and 404 BCE. Thucydides, writing over two thousand years ago, was not a ‘realist’ because IR theory
        did not exist in named form until the twentieth century. However, when looking back from a contemporary vantage
        point, theorists detected many similarities in the thought patterns and behaviours of the ancient world and the
        modern world. They then drew on his writings, and that of others, to lend weight to the idea that there was a
        timeless theory spanning all recorded human history. That theory was named ‘realism’.

    <h2>The basics of realism</h2>
    <p>
        The first assumption of realism is that the nation-state (usually abbreviated to ‘state’) is the principle actor
        in international relations. Other bodies exist, such as individuals and organisations, but their power is
        limited. Second, the state is a unitary actor. National interests, especially in times of war, lead the state to
        speak and act with one voice. Third, decision-makers are rational actors in the sense that rational
        decision-making leads to the pursuit of the national interest.</p>
    <h3>Realism and the Islamic State Group</h3>
    <p>The Islamic State group (also known as IS, Daesh, ISIS or ISIL) is a militant group that follows a fundamentalist
        doctrine of Sunni Islam. In June 2014, the group published a document where it claimed to have traced the
        lineage of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, back to the prophet Muhammad. The group then appointed al-Baghdadi
        its ‘caliph’. As caliph, al-Baghdadi demanded the allegiance of devout Muslims worldwide and the group and its
        supporters set about conducting a range of extreme and barbaric acts.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Realism is a theory that claims to explain the reality of international politics. It emphasises the constraints
        on politics that result from humankind’s egoistic nature and the absence of a central authority above the state.
        For realists, the highest goal is the survival of the state, which explains why states’ actions are judged
        according to the ethics of responsibility rather than by moral principles.</p>
